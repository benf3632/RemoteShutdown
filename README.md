# RemoteShutdown

## About The Project
Remote Shutdown Server is an application that enables 
you to start a shutdown timer for your computer from your phone with an app.

## Languages Used
The app was written in flutter.
The server was written in c#.

## How I thought about this project and why I programmed it 
I thought of this idea from a need. Sometimes I forget to start the timer on my computer 
when I go to sleep and then my computer runs all night long.
Then I thought what if there was an app than allows me to start a shutdown timer remotly.
I wanted to search for it on the web, instead I came up with an idea, why dont I make it myself.
I have the knowledge both in desktop application developing and mobile developing so I started
this Project.
